Psychiatric services such as psychiatric consultation and  medication management

Our work is grounded in scientific research and phenomenological inquiry. Our approach is collaborative, respectful, and tailored to meet your specific needs. 
 
We are committed to helping you examine what you do that leads you towards or away from health, experiment with things you can change, and learn how to live peacefully with what is beyond your control.
